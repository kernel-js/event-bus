# @kernel-js/event-bus<br />

> Publish and listen to messages between application layers or between applications (Micro Front-end)

## Why

First of all I created this to support development of [Kernel Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kernel-js/framework).<br />
Just like the rest of the packages that make up the framework, I make the most of other existing libraries that are well
tested on a day-to-day basis. The idea is not to reinvent the wheel, just join the ideas in a lightweight framework
(the focus is on the client side), simple to use and make the code on the front more beautiful and organized.
